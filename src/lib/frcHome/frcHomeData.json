    "description": "With the conclusion of kickoff and the new game announced, ILITE is excited for the new season. Together with new and returning members, we are ready to tackle this challenge! This year we are proud to participate in the new, unique First Robotics Competition, Destination: Deep Space. This is the first competition to not have a dedicated autonomous peroid at the beginning of the match. Instead they have added a period called Sandstorm, which allows both driver control, and autonomous to be run. Learn more about this peroid and the rest of the game by clicking on the button below.",

    "description": "Each year, on kickoff day, all of ILITE gathers together to watch the new game reveal. Following the release, the team moves on to discussing each aspect of the game to ensure no factor in the game is overseen. By involving all team members in the discussion process, both technical and non-technical, our hope is to come up with ideas that technical team members might not have thought about.",
