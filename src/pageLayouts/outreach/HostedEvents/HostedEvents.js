            <p>
              Every year, ILITE Robotics hosts a district event for week one of
              the FRC season. We host more than 30 teams every competition - a number that has continued to grow
              since we have started hosting these competitions! This year we're excited to participate in Destination: Deep Space.

              A unique opportunity to explore the various aspects of science,
              technology, engineering, art, and mathematics. In this annual

              We here at ILITE firmly believe that all children deserve to learn
              about the wonders of the world around us through the exploration
              of STEM. We offer a variety of STEM summer camps, in areas such as
              cyber security, FLL, and engineering. The camps are taught and run
              by ILITE students. We hope you enjoy our camps!
