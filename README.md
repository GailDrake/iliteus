# ILITE US
This is the ILITE website code repository, powered by React, Gatsby, GraphQL, and Contentful. This page will describe the overall site 

### Buzzwords
This team (and this guide) will often use buzzwords that you should know before working on the rest of the website. 

* HTML5 - There are different version of HTML

### Getting Started
If you contributing to this repo, then you are most likely a member of the ILITE Robotics team. To contribute to this repository, you need to have a text editor. We recommend Visual Studio Code and Atom.

If you are contributing to this repository, then you need to have a few other tools that you need to have installed.
* NodeJS - server side javascript
* NPM - node package manager
* Yarn - a superior package manager
* Git Bash - a Linux style terminal
* Gatsby - the platform 

To install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), head to their website and select the latest version that fits your operating system. The installer will install both NodeJS and the NPM package manager. This repository doesn't use NodeJS, but we do use NPM scripts very frequently. We will use NPM as a method of building the project and running development servers.

To install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), install the executable from their website. We consider Yarn to be a superior package manager because of its speed and consistency, but we install NPM anyway because Yarn relies on NodeJS.

We also use the terminal very frequently. If you are on Windows, then install [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads). If you are on Mac, then the default terminal is fine. Having either of these terminals allows you to run some of the Linux styled commands, which are invaluable when coding. These include `ls` and `rm -rf`.

To install [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), run the following command in your terminal.
```
yarn install --global gatsby-cli
```
This is the platform we will build our website on.
