# Setup
## Installation
From the command line, in the directory where you want to install this project, run:
'git clone https://github.com/GailDrake/iliteus.git'
`cd iliteus`
`yarn install`

## Local development environment:
From the command line, in the root `ilite` folder, type `yarn start`. This will run a development server, and compile all LESS and JavaScript files. You can view the app on `localhost:8080` in your browser. The dev server will run continuously and will update as you change and save files.

# Style guides

### LESS style guide
[ilite style guide] (https://github.com/GailDrake/ilite/wiki/Less-Style-guide) - A short, but authoritative style guide. Memorize it. Follow it. Teach it to your friends.

[Airbnb CSS Style Guide] (https://github.com/airbnb/css) - A very well written and comprehensive guide to CSS and Sass. We're using Less, but they're basically the same. For any conflicts with the ilite style guide, this loses.


### Javascript style guide
[Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide] (https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) - Great general guidelines, and the style guide I've been seeing many companies use lately.


#### Note:
Do not touch the `dist` folder. It's regenerated when `yarn build` is executed, and will be completely overwritten.
